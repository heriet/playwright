### vars_file

Perhaps you may want to place credential vars in a different place.

```
|
|--inspirations
|  |--myinspiration.yml
|
|--playbooks
|  |--vars
|  |  |--credentials.yml
|  |
|  |--roles
|  |  |--nifcloud
|  |
|  |--requirements.txt
|  |--myplaybook.yml
|
```

credentials.yml

```
---

nifcloud_users:
  <YOUR USER ID>:
    access_key: <YOUR ACCESS KEY>
    secret_access_key: <YOUR SECRET ACCESS KEY>
```

myinspiration.yml
```
---

playwright_options:
  playbook_path: playbooks

vars_files:
  - vars/credentials.yml

inspirations:
  - playhouse: nifcloud
    user: <YOUR USER ID>
    modules:
      - module: nifcloud_fw
```

playwright find vars_files from `playwright_options.playbook_path` (for describe user resources), and vars_files are generated to myplaybook.yml

```
$ playwright inspire inspirations/myinspiration.yml > playbooks/myplaybook.yml
```

## Reference

### Config File

#### vars

#### vars_files

#### inspirations

```
inspirations:
  - playhouse: nifcloud
    user: <YOUR USER ID>
    regions:
      - name: jp-east-1
    modules:
      - module: nifcloud_fw
```

### Plauhouse: nifcloud

#### regions

List of region names or 'all'.

```
inspirations:
  - playhouse: nifcloud
    user: <YOUR USER ID>
    regions: all
    modules:
      - module: nifcloud_fw
```

If regions sets 'all' or not defined, playwright call `DescribeRegions` to configure regions.

#### modules

##### nifcloud_fw

```
    modules:
      - module: nifcloud_fw
        describe_params:
          GroupName.1: jupyterlab
        excludes:
          - key: groupName
            regexp: e\d+aut
```

- describe_params
  - nifcloud_fw module calls `DescribeSecurityGroups`. `describe_params` are additional parameter for `DescribeSecurityGroups`.
- excrudes
  - If it matches the condition of exclude in the response of `DescribeSecurityGroups`, matched fw will not generate playbook task.
